            <p class="justifytext">Over the years medications have become more advanced, BUT so have prices. Brand name
                medications are amongst the top reasons for medication non-adherence, financial burden to patients, and
                health inequity. Many of these brand name medications seem to only be available to patients who can
                afford them, excluding those who are uninsured, low income, financially-constrained, or even those who
                have worked their entire lives to be on Medicare, just to find out their medication is not covered, or
                the deductible is too high for them to even consider buying medications that may add years to their
                life.</p>

            <h1 class="centertext"><u>Why we care</u></h1>
            <p class="justifytext"><img class="me" src="businessprofessional.JPG"><br>
                I am a practicing clinical pharmacist that is passionate about patients being able to take the best
                therapies that will improve their quality of life and reduce mortality. My family is similar to many
                families across the United States. Both my parents are baby boomers who are now approaching Medicare
                age. My dad worked for the same company for 41 years, 3am to 4pm, before retiring. He has now been
                retired for three short years and is pouring his hard-earned money into his prescription medications. He
                has been blessed enough to have received samples of some of his medications to help keep him out of the
                hospital and at home, enjoying his retirement. Now that he is at Medicare enrollment age, he is sifting
                through multiple companies to see how to best afford his brand name insulin and other brand name
                medications. I therefore set out on a quest to evaluate how he could best be served, along with the rest
                of the nation. This led to the creation of M.A.G.I.C., The Medication Assistance Guide for Improving
                Care.<br><br>

            <h1 class="centertext"><u>What is a patient assistance program (PAP)</u></h1>
            <p class="justifytext">A patient assistance program (PAP) is when a drug manufacturer offers their brand's
                medication for FREE to eliminate financial barriers for qualifying patients. These programs actually
                send the medication directly to a patient's home for a year. For Medicare patients with fixed incomes,
                you may qualify for the rest of your life! Are there a lot of these programs? Yes! Why do drug companies
                offer these programs? I believe there are tax incentives for these multi-billion dollar companies to
                offer these programs. There are 27+ drug companies that offer PAPs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1 class="centertext"><u>Why have you never heard of a PAP</u></h1>
            <p class="justifytext">PAP programs are grossly underutilized. Picture these large companies offering these
                programs but patients not knowing they exist due to pertinent details being deeply embedded in their
                websites! What if I told you the majority of even healthcare professionals are unaware of the extent of
                available programs? Imagine you're listening to a long advertisement that ends in "Call for Eligibility
                Details"; that is the current state of PAP programs being difficult to access.</p>

            <h1 class="centertext"><u>What is M.A.G.I.C.</u></h1>
            <p class="justifytext">Medication Assistance Guide for Improving Care (M.A.G.I.C.), is a comprehensive,
                fully-interactive collection of available patient assistance programs (PAP) for brand name drugs in the
                United States. It is designed with the patient in mind, attempting to make eligibility criteria as clear
                as possible. Our mission is to save patients from having to use alternative medications, save patients
                money, and eliminate inequity that exists in patient care due to cost of brand name prescription
                medications. M.A.G.I.C. is designed that ANYONE should be able to use the system and least know whether
                or not they qualify for a PAP program.</p>
