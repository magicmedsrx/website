				<p class="justifyText">
					Over the years medications have become more advanced, BUT so have prices. Brand name
					medications are amongst the top reasons for medication non-adherence, financial burden to
					patients, and health inequity. Many of these brand name medications seem to only be
					available to patients who can afford them, excluding those who are uninsured, low income,
					financially-constrained, or even those who have worked their entire lives to be on
					Medicare, just to find out their medication is not covered, or the deductible is too high
					for them to even consider buying medications that may add years to their life.

					<img class="aboutImage" src="./img/businessprofessional.jpg" />
					I am a practicing clinical pharmacist that is passionate about patients being able to take
					the best therapies that will improve their quality of life and reduce mortality. My family
					is similar to many families across the United States. Both my parents are baby boomers who
					are now approaching Medicare age. My dad worked for the same company for 41 years, 3am to
					4pm, before retiring. He has now been retired for three short years and is pouring his
					hard-earned money into his prescription medications. He has been blessed enough to have
					received samples of some of his medications to help keep him out of the hospital and at
					home, enjoying his retirement. Now that he is at Medicare enrollment age, he is sifting
					through multiple companies to see how to best afford his brand name insulin and other
					brand name medications. I therefore set out on a quest to evaluate how he could best be
					served, along with the rest of the nation. This led to the creation of M.A.G.I.C., The
					Medication Assistance Guide for Improving Care.

				<h1 class="centerTitle"><u>What is a patient assistance program (PAP)</u></h1>
				<p class="justifyText">
					A patient assistance program (PAP) is when a drug manufacturer offers their brand's
					medication for FREE to eliminate financial barriers for qualifying patients. These
					programs actually send the medication directly to a patient's home for a year. For
					Medicare patients with fixed incomes, you may qualify for the rest of your life! Are there
					a lot of these programs? Yes! Why do drug companies offer these programs? I believe there
					are tax incentives for these multi-billion dollar companies to offer these programs. There
					are 27+ drug companies that offer PAPs.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1 class="centerTitle"><u>Why have you never heard of a PAP</u></h1>
				<p class="justifyText">
					PAP programs are grossly underutilized. Picture these large companies offering these
					programs but patients not knowing they exist due to pertinent details being deeply
					embedded in their websites! What if I told you the majority of even healthcare
					professionals are unaware of the extent of available programs? Imagine you're listening to
					a long advertisement that ends in "Call for Eligibility Details"; that is the current
					state of PAP programs being difficult to access.
				</p>

				<h1 class="centerTitle"><u>What is M.A.G.I.C.</u></h1>
				<p class="justifyText">
					Medication Assistance Guide for Improving Care (M.A.G.I.C.), is a comprehensive,
					fully-interactive collection of available patient assistance programs (PAP) for brand name
					drugs in the United States. It is designed with the patient in mind, attempting to make
					eligibility criteria as clear as possible. Our mission is to save patients from having to
					use alternative medications, save patients money, and eliminate inequity that exists in
					patient care due to cost of brand name prescription medications. M.A.G.I.C. is designed
					that ANYONE should be able to use the system and least know whether or not they qualify
					for a PAP program.
